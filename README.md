# Node js Master Class Homework assignment #2
## PIZZA LODGE

**API for making Pizza orders**

## Setup

### Prerequizites:
- Node.js LTS installed
- HTTPS certificates generated
- Stripe account
- Mailgun account

### Configuring the project
After cloning the repo create **config.js** file in the lib directory like so:

```Javascript

const environments = {};

environments.['/*environment name*/'] = {
  'httpPort' : 3000,
  'httpsPort' : 3001,
  'envName' : '/*environment name*/',
  'hashingSecret' : 'topSecret',
  'stripeSecret' : '/*your secret*/',
  'currency' : '/*your currency*/',
  'mailgun' : {
    'sender' : '/*your mailgun address*/',
    'apiKey' : '/*your API key*/' ,
    'domain' : '/*your domain*/'
  }
};

const currentEnvironment = typeof process.env.NODE_ENV === 'string' ?
  process.env.NODE_ENV.toLowerCase() : '';

const environmentToExport = typeof environments[currentEnvironment] === 'object' ?
  environments[currentEnvironment] : environments.staging;

module.exports = environments;

```
Edit **menu.json** file in the /.data folder to update the menu with your own.


## Usage

Place your key.pem and cert.pem files inside https/ folder in the project directory.
Start the project by running **NODE_ENV=your_environment node index** in the terminal.
Now you have the following endpoints available by the ports you have specified in the config file.
